# Blog template
This is a simple template for a blog.

## Initial setup


- goto Settings and scroll down to GitHub Pages section

- switch the __None__ option to __master branch__

- edit `_config.yml` file and follow the instructions in the comments

- edit the `about.md` file to include some information about yourself
(make sure that you are using markdown to format this page)


- Follow instructions in the _config.yml file to customize it.
- Use the files in _posts as a template for blog posts. The file HAS to be names with
a date of the post followed by the title:
  YYYY-MM-DD-tiltle.md


## Creating blog posts

The blog posts (weekly or otherwise) are created by adding markdown formatted files
to the `_posts` directory. The file name has to match a very specific format
`YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`, for example `2018-01-28-week01.md`.  The template should
contain a file for the first one or two posts for the students to use.
Each of the files corresponds to a single blog post.

## Changing layouts (optional)

The provided template has a very simple design. Each student can customize this
basic layout by changing the files in `_layouts` directory, `index.html` file and `style.scss` file. For more information about it, go through [Jekyll](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/jf2920-weekly) documentation pages.
